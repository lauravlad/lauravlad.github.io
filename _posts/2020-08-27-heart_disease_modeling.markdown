Cardiovascular disease describes a range of conditions that affect your heart and blood vessels. Diseases under the heart disease umbrella include blood vessel diseases, such as coronary artery disease; heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias); and heart defects you're born with (congenital heart defects), among others. Cardiovascular disease refers to diseases involving blockage or narrowing of major blood vessels and it can lead to heart attacks, angina and stroke. The main cause for blood vessels' narrowing and blockages is the build up of plaque or artheroma. Main symptom for heart attacks is chest pain. The most important risk factors for cardiovascular disease are: smoking, alchohol drinking, high cholesterol and diabetes.
