    I remember like it was yesterday; Monday afternoon 1.30, I was supposed to zoom meet Eli, my new instructor at Flatiron School of Data Science.  Eli was a thirty something young male and I am a forty something 'young' woman. I was pretty confident that a thirty something young guy cannot teach me things about life anymore so I couldn't hide my boredom. He asked me if I have any questions for him, so I asked him his thoughts on the configuration of my computer, he told me that an Apple computer would be better for the journey I was embarking to, for the next ten months. 
   But I hate Apple! I said, remembering the awful experience I had with apple repairs after I broke my phone's the display. 
   It was insured, so I didn't give it a second thought and I sent it to apple repairs to be fixed.   They sent it right back without touching it. I called the customer service and the lady I was talking to told me with a bored voice: It has been repaired. 
   No, it has not been repaired, I replied slightly annoyed.
   How do you know, she asked me candidly? 
   I'm looking at a broken screen, I said rolling my eyes. Disapointed that she cannot see my unhappy face.
   It took them a month to fix it, so I was still pretty upset since the 'wound’ was pretty open, still. 
   I used to be one of those people who would wait in front of the apple store to get the new phone. Not anymore. I switched from loving Apple to hating Apple. 
   Very calmly Eli answered me: this is just a brand; it doesn't deserve your emotions.
   Wait! What? You are so right they don't. I said, after a moment of silence.  I was wrong, a thirty something wise guy was still able teach me things. 
   Fast forward a few months later I have to build a model that will predict positive/ negative tweets about apple or google products and services.
   High emotions regarding products or services might not be useful to the owner of the emotion, unless you are at a party and you don’t want to talk about weather.  They surely are useful to the company the emotion is directed to. 
   Why? 
   Tell me how your customer service is, and I'll tell you if you make money or not.
   Positive tweets can pe used for training purposes or to showcase company’s success.
 Negative tweets can be used to find unhappy customers and try to understand the source of their frustration.
 Having a good model to predict whether a tweet is positive or negative can save a lot of energy and money replacing the human work on labeling tweets.
