    I remember like it was yesterday; Monday afternoon 1.30, I was supposed to zoommeet Eli, my new instructor at Flatiron School of Datascience.  Eli was a thirty something young male and I am a forty something 'young' woman. I was pretty confident that  a thirty something young guy cannot teach me things about life anymore so I couldn't hide my boredom. He asked me if I have any questions for him I asked him what would be a good configuration for my computer and he told me that an Apple computer would be better for what I was embarking  to do in the next 10 months. But I hate Apple! I said remembering  the awfull experience I had with apple repairs after I broke my phone's the display. 
    It was insured, so I didn't give it a second thought and I sent it to apple repairs to be fixed. They sent it back without touching it. I called the customer service and the lady I was talking to, told me it has been repaired. No, it was not, I replied obviously annoyed. How do you know, she asked me candidly. I'm looking at a broken screen, I said rolling my eyes. 
		It took them a month to fix it so I was still pretty upset since the 'wound'  was pretty open still . 
		I used to be one of those people who would wait in front of the apple store to get the new phone, not anymore. 
    Very calmly Eli answered me: this are just a brands, they don't deserve your emotions.
    Wait! What? You are so right they don't. I was wrong, a thirty something wise guy was still able teach me things. 
		Fast forward a few months later I have to build a model that will predict positive/ negative tweets about apple or google products and services.
		High emotions regarding products or services might not be usefull to the owner of the emotion but they surely are useful to the company the emotion is directed to.
		Why? Tell me how your customer service is and I'll tell you if you make money or not.
